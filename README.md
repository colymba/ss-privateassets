SilverStripe Private Assets
===========================
This module makes (some) assets only accessible to logged in users. Any file (not images or scripts) uploaded under `assets/private/**` will require login to be viewed/downloaded.

## Requirements
* [SilverStripe Framework 3.1](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework)

### Htaccess
Paste this in your root `.htaccess` file in the SilverStripe section, after the `RewriteBase '/'` line.

```apacheconf
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /assets/private [NC]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \.(pdf|zip|rar|7z|doc|docx|xls|xlsx|ppt|pptx)$ [NC]
RewriteRule .* privateassets?file=%{REQUEST_FILENAME}&%{QUERY_STRING} [L,NC]
```

## TODO
* a lot
* make this configarable through an admin
